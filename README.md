# CW Mapper
A tool to validate the Crusader Wars unit mapping.

## 📝 To-Do List
☑ ~~Revamp the validation code, splitting the code into cleaner components~~
\
↳ ☑ ~~Move the reports into it's own contained folder~~
\
↳ ☑ ~~Create a config handler for map <-> mod which can be used for 
checking what MAA/Cultures are needed plus for future use when people will create their own mappers, with what mods are needed~~
\
↳ ☑ ~~Provide a summary/log.txt which can be fed into a UI.~~

☑ ~~Develop a simple UI~~
\
↳ ☑ ~~Update the summary display UI to display the instructions to obtain the .tsv's from TW:Attila for when missing in tooling~~

☐ Develop a simple way to build a mapper, based on Earl's existing mapper (just map it to the mapper that's found in CW currently), or alternatively, from scratch based on the code brought in from CW data.
\
↳ ☑ Proper per faction display
\
↳ ☑ Heritage/Culture <> Faction mapper
\
↳ ☑ Key loading from available sources
\
↳ ☑ Saving and loading mappers (will need future fix for additional culture/heritage/faction data)
\
↳ ☐ Add in logic for levy size/MAA size
\
↳ ☐ Create mapper based on existing mapper (loading xmls)
\
↳ ☐ Mapping instructions
