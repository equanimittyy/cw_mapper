170217-00001 - Fix duplicate title section with conflicting info in summary log
================================================================================

Severity: Medium (misleading validation output)

Location: cw_map_checker.py:612-651 (summary() function)

Problem:
The summary log printed the Titles section twice per mapper with conflicting information.
The first instance always reported "No missing keys found" (false positive), while the
second showed the actual title key validation results.

Root cause: The generic missing_keys/missing_attila_keys reporting block (lines 612-634)
ran for ALL file types including titles. For titles files, missing_keys was always empty
(only populated for cultures/MAA), so it always printed a false "no missing keys" result.
Then the title-specific validation block (lines 636-648) printed a second "Titles:" header
with the real data.

Example of broken output:
    Titles:
    > No missing keys found for ..._cw_titles.csv    <-- WRONG (checking empty MAA/culture data)
    Titles:
    > Missing title keys: 30 missing keys             <-- CORRECT (actual title validation)

Fix:
Wrapped the generic missing_keys/missing_attila_keys reporting in a condition that only
runs for cultures.csv and maa.csv files. Removed the duplicate "Titles:" header from the
title validation block since it was already printed at line 601 when entering the titles
processing section.

Result: Each mapper now shows exactly one Titles section with accurate validation data.
